Share your skills New web application site
This is a new site that im working on for school as a final project and 
i think it will be a good one it will be like github but more basic and mainly ment for college students 
"Having issues and been spinning my wheels on it" (Fix one issue than create another to fix the other go back to the original issue again and again maybe a type-o somewhere)
